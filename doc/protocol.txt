This document describes the protocol between the hash client "hc" and hash
daemon "hd".

The protocol use gob.  See http://blog.golang.org/gobs-of-data

The struct used is:

  type HashWireMessage struct {
  	Cmd    string
  	Key    string
  	Value  string
  	Status string
  }

The same struct is used for messages sent by both the client and the server.

Commands are passed in the Cmd field.  Valid values are "GET" and "PUT".

GET commands:

- Requests using the GET command leave the Value and Status empty.
- Responses to GET include the Cmd and Key in addition to the Value.
- Responses to GET set Status to "EXISTS" when the key is not found.
- Responses to GET set Status to "NOEXISTS" when the key & value were found.

PUT commands:

- Requests using PUT require the Key and Value.  The Status is empty.
- PUT responses include the Cmd and Key but leave the Value empty.
- PUT responses set Status to "ERROR" on failure and "OK" on success.

Invalid commands cause the status "INVALIDCMD" to be returned.
